# Self-hosted Cookbook

If you're like me and love not only to self-host, but to constantly test new apps, you probably already discovered `docker-compose` as the fastest and easiest way towards that goal.
There is, however, one problem: not all image authors are as great as [linuxserver.io](https://hub.docker.com/u/linuxserver), whose docs are as simple as they should be: you just copy & paste `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker-compose up -d` and IT JUST WORKS!<br>
This is how all images should be documented!<br>
But unfortunately, it isn't!<br>
Sometimes you have to spend a lot of time to make it work.<br>
Hence - this repo.<br>
The aims is to provide a ready-to-run recipes that you can just copy, paste and run.



# How to use this cookbook
- There are certain things that some recipes need which cannot be filled in due to security reasons.
  - `example.com` needs to be replaced with your own domain
  - `username`, `password`, etc. - should be replaced by your username & password
  - keys (like `APP_KEY`, `SECRET` etc.) should be regenerated using e.g. `openssl rand -base64 32`
- Not all apps have been tested & described. These are marked as ðŸ”— (external links).
