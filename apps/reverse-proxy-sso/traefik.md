# Traefik
This is one of the best reverse-proxy solutions for self-hosting.
Very easy to run & maintain (once you pass the setup).<br>

Traefik can detect docker services and use docker labels to automatically create routes.
However, I prefer to keep my docker-compose files clean and explicitly set routers & services myself, so this solution does exactly that.<br>

Traefik can also be set-up to automatically provide Let's Encrypt certs for your services.
However, there are some services that need cert files (AdGuard Home, Mailcow), and because I want to have a single wildcard certificate for my whole domain (and all subdomains) I prefer to generate it manually (i.e. scripts in cron) and just reference it whenever it's required - so this setup reflects that.

## General overview
Traefik has 2 types of config:
- static - requires restart of the container
- dynamic - refreshes live.

Dynamic config can be provided as a folder, where all `toml`/`yml` files are parsed and configuration from them is applied to the running server.<br>

You can create multiple files and split the dynamic config to your preference. I prefer to keep 1 main file (for tls/cert settings and global middlewares), and then add 1 config file per service (with route & service definition).<br>

It's also good to keep a note with a table of service-port mapping (to quickly see which ports are used by which service).
