# NTFY
A self-hosted notification server (like pushover).

- has mobile apps for ios and android
- interesting conceptually (simple pub-sub)
- very easy to use (from curl to php)
- notifications arrive promptly, within seconds (1 - 10) (not as instant as e.g. pushover)
- sometimes apps need to be restarted to show notifications (sometimes a notification shows up in notification center, but not in the app)
- no sync between clients - i.e. the same notification must be marked as read or dismissed in all subscribers (in pushover, when I read one on my phone - it shows as read on laptop)
