## Tips & Tricks
After starting the app - check the logs.
- If there are errors, log-in to container's shell:
    ```sh
    dc exec screenly sh
    ```
- If the errors are about the APP_KEY, inside the container, run:
    ```sh
    php artisan key:generate
    ```
- If there are errors about the DB records, run:
    ```sh
    php artisan migrate --force
    ```
Then register & log-in & generate API key for NextCloud.
